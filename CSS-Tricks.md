## CSS Tricks

### Center element horizontally

Imagine you have an element that is small but there is plenty of room left to it's right. 
How do you center it?

```margin: 0 auto```

When you have specified a width on the object that you have applied margin: 0 auto to, the object will sit centrally within it's parent container.
